If you wish to initialise your site with the demo content, copy the contents of the `themes/academic/exampleSite/` folder to your website root folder, overwriting existing files if necessary. The `exampleSite` folder contains an example config file and content to help you get started. The following command can be used to accomplish this:

```bash
cp -av themes/academic/exampleSite/* .
```
